The GitHub repository is connected to your Lovable project, allowing you to edit content in multiple ways:

To edit text, images, and content on your site, you'll primarily need to modify these files:

For project data: Edit src/data/projects.ts - This contains all your project information including titles, descriptions, images, etc.

For page content: Files in the src/pages directory control what appears on each page:

Index.tsx (home page)
About.tsx (about page)
Contact.tsx (contact page)
ProjectDetail.tsx (individual project pages)
For images:

You can use URLs to images hosted elsewhere (like you're currently doing with Unsplash)
Or upload images to your GitHub repository (in a /public or /assets folder) and reference them locally
For components: If you want to change how certain elements look, you'd edit files in src/components/

The most common file you'll want to edit is src/data/projects.ts whenever you want to add or update a project. To add a new project, you would add a new object to the projects array with all the required fields from the Project type defined in src/types/Project.ts.
